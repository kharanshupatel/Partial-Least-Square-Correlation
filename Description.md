### Method: Partial Least Square Correlation (PLSC)
```
Partial Least Square (PLS) method compares the information in two data tables on the same set of observations. This method is also referred as projection to latent structures. To find the shared information between these two tables, the approach is equivalent to a correlation problem and the technique is then called partial least square correlation (PLSC). 
In PLSC, there are two sets of latent variables and these latent variables are required to have maximal covariance.
Latent variables are new variables obtained as linear combinations of the original variables.
These latent variables, which describe the observations, are required to explain the largest portion of the covariance between the two tables. The original variables are described by their saliences.

### Dataset : PLSC - oasis_cross-sectional
```
The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) is a project aimed at making MRI data sets of the brain freely available to the scientific community.
It is a cross-sectional MRI Data in Young, Middle Aged, Nondemented and Demented Older Adults.
This set consists of a cross-sectional collection of 216 subjects (rows) aged 33 to 96. The subjects include both men and women. 
It measures 216 subjects (rows) on 4 quanitiative variables (columns). 
For PLSC, the original dataset was divided into two separate tables based on the variables. Both tables consist of same rows.
